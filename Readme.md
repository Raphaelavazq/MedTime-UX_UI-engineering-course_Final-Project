# Overview

Congratulations on completing a 5-month full-time UX/UI engineering course!

Throughout the course, you covered modules on UX/UI best practices, such as using Figma for prototyping, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, and Storybook!  

For your final course project, you will create a React application demonstrating your understanding of the key concepts. 

This project can be an individual or a pair effort. During the project, you will showcase your skills in building interactive and user-friendly web applications. You will also lead yourself and organise the execution of your project, starting from the idea and delivering it to the users. If you choose to collaborate with somebody, you will put your collaboration skills to the test.

## Disclaimer
The brief has space for interpretation on purpose. 

The final project of this course is ultimately the time to put all that you learned during the last five months into practice. 

Acknowledging that UX/UI engineering is a vast umbrella term for many specialisations, we understand that the critical skill set might vary for various people in this course. This might depend on their current level of experience, their decision about which roles they plan to apply for, or their decision about which direction they want to change their current career track. 

Please talk to the instructor while ideating your project and defining specifications.

## Project requirements
### Basic
* A web application created with React with interactive elements.
* Use of concepts like component-based development and atomic design.
* Ensure your application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
* Use of CSS or SCSS for custom styling of the UI or a library of your choosing.
* A project tracker: board at GitHub project, Notion, Trello, or other similar tool you prefer.
* Readme file with an outline of the project.
* Use of git as a version control system.
* Your project published on the internet (e.g. with GitHub pages).

### Optional
* Documented user flow (you decide how)
* Documented user research (you decide how)
* Mockups for your web application (decide which degree of fidelity is relevant for your project)
* Styleguide implemented or component library in Figma
* Storybook integration with documentation of components of your web app.
* One or some third-party API calls to fetch the data.
* Exploring new libraries or tools you might want to give a try (libraries for animations, )


### Documentation and Presentation

**README File:**

Accompany your project with a README file for your project that includes:
* project description
* instructions for setting up and running the project
* list of dependencies and how to install them
* brief explanation of the project structure
* any other relevant information in your opinion

**Project Presentation:**
* Prepare a presentation to demonstrate your project.
* Explain the main features, how you integrated the API, and show your Storybook stories.
* Timing: 10-12 minutes +  

## Submission Guidelines

* **Repository**: Use this repository to work on your project and push your code to GitHub class organisation. 

* (When applicable) **Figma project**: Use your team folder to store your project, make your project available to others to view. Manage permissions accordingly, keep edit rights for yourself. 

* **Commit regularly**: This will help you track your progress and manage the changes. It will also help your instructors provide feedback on your code if you have questions during the process.

## Evaluation Criteria (when applicable)

* UI/UX documentation: How well the UI/UX articulated in Figma, the use of components in Figma, and the integration of Storybook.
* Functionality: How well your application works and meets the project requirements.
* Code Quality: The readability, maintainability and documentation of your code.
* Presentation: How well you present and explain your project.
